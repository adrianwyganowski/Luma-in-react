# Magento 2 Luma theme in React

Work in progress.

In this project I am trying to create single page app looking like luma theme, using react. Until now I made:
-  main page, all categories pages in mobile and desktop version,
-  most of the catalog page (not working sidebar menu and products data are hard coded for every category of products)
-  product page only in desktop version.

In file structure of this app I borrow Magento 2 naming convetion.
